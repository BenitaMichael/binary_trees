# Binary Trees:
Binary trees are a data structure in which a record is linked to two successor records, usually referred to as the left branch when greater and the right when less than the previous record.
It is a data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child.

## Difference Between Binary Trees and Binary Search Tree
A Binary Tree is a basic structure with a simple rule that no parent must have more than 2 children whereas the Binary Search Tree is a variant of the binary tree following a particular order with which the nodes should be organized.
